Do not install 3rd party programs or scripts unless you absolutely trust the source
Do not blindly copy and paste terminal command you find on the internet
Do not su or sudo without understanding why you need to have root privilages
Never chmod to 777
Never execute a command recursively unless it is absolutely necessary
Never play to directories outside of /home unless you know exactly what you'r doing
Don't worry if something breaks
